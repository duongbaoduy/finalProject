We decided to implement 
=========A=============
tfs_displayFragments() 
tfs_defrag()
=========B=============
tfs_rename()
tfs_readdir()
=========D=============
tfs_makeRO()
tfs_makeRW(char *name)
tfs_writeByte(fileDescriptor FD, unsigned int data)
=========E=============
tfs_readFileInfo(fileDescriptor FD)
=========H=============
File System Consistency Checks


They are tested with our driver. You will see a printf and then the results. If there is an error, an error message will be printed out.
Each extra feature that we implemented has it's own test method called in the main in our test driver except for defrag.
Defrag testing is contained in the phaseTwo() test method in our driver which is called in the main as well.
PhaseTwo() tests the functions that were required of everyone for TinyFS.

No bugs were detected through our testing.
